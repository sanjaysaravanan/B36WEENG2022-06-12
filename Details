  map, filter, find, reduce

  map vs forEach

  forEach:
    use: iterate throw array
    returnType: undfined
  
  map:
    use: iterate throw each element and collect all the return of each iteration
    returnType: array of all the return on each iteration

  filter:
    use: iterate the array and collects/filters the element which meets the condition into an arr
    returnType: array of filtered elements

  find:
    use: iterate and collect the first element that matches the condition
    returnType: first element which matched the condition
  
  reduce:
    use: uses a callback/reducer function which iterates as 1st element( 0 index ) --> prevVal, 2n(1 index) --> currVal. further iteration accumulates all the value to prevVal and atlast prevVal  is returned. If an initial then iteration initialValue --> prevVal, 1st element(0 index) --> currVal

    returnType: accumulated value in prevVal
